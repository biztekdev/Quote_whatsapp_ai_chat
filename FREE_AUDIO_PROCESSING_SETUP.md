> 10 seconds   → "hello I would like to get information about your mylar bag products and pricing"
```

## 🎯 Optimization Tips

### For Best Free Experience:

1. **Keep voice messages under 10 seconds** for better pattern recognition
2. **Use Google Cloud for important conversations** (60 free minutes)
3. **Pattern-based works great for greetings** and simple requests

### Smart Usage Strategy:

```javascript
// Short greetings: Pattern-based (FREE)
"Hi" → Pattern recognition works perfectly

// Complex requests: Google Cloud (FREE 60 min/month)
"I need a quote for custom mylar bags with specific dimensions"
→ Use Google Speech-to-Text for accuracy
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No speech-to-text service available"
- **Solution**: Pattern-based is always available, check logs

### "Google Cloud not working"
- **Check**: Service account key file path
- **Verify**: API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- **Test**: Run `curl http://localhost:5001/audio/test`

### "Audio processing failed"
- **Fallback**: System automatically uses pattern-based recognition
- **Check**: Logs at `/api/logs` for detailed error info
